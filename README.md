# LeetCode Solutions

A public repository of optimal Leetcode solutions in both Python and Rust. 

## Repository Structure

```
leetcode-solutions/
└── problems/               # Problems are organized by difficulty
    ├── easy/             
    │   └── two_sum/        # Each problem has its own directory
    │       ├── README.md           # Problem description and solution explanation
    │       ├── solution.py         # Python implementation
    │       └── solution.rs         # Rust implementation

```

## Implementation Approach

Each coding problem has a README.md with the following sections: 
- Problem Description
- Naive Solution
- Key Insight
- Optimal Solution
- Algorithm Explanation
- Time Complexity Analysis
- Space Complexity Analysis 

Each coding problem comes with a Python implementation.
For some coding problems, a Rust implementation has been provided as well.
